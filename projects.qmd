## Business Running Case: Evaluating Personal Job Market Prospects in 2024
### **Topic**: Salary & Compensation Trends

* How do salaries differ across AI vs. non-AI careers?
* What regions offer the highest-paying jobs in AI-related and traditional careers?
* Are remote jobs better paying than in-office roles?
* What industries saw the biggest wage growth in 2024?

### Expected Findings
Through this research, we anticipate identifying key patterns in data science salaries, such as:

* An increase in salaries for AI and machine learning specialists due to growing demand.
* Potential stagnation or decline in entry-level data science salaries due to an influx of new professionals entering the field.
* A widening salary gap between regions due to remote work policies and cost-of-living differences.
* Industry-specific salary trends, where certain sectors may offer higher compensation based on their reliance on data-driven insights.
